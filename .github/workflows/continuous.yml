            ## Linux (including Raspberry Pi)

            The Debian package is still a work in progess.  Please use one of the AppImages.

            The AppImages should be compatible with all modern 64-bit distros.  Download the `aarch64` AppImage for 64-bit ARM computers (e.g. Raspberry Pi), or the `x86_64` AppImage for 64-bit Intel/AMD computers.

            - First make the AppImage file executable by running `chmod +x EspoTek_Labrador*.AppImage`
            - Now you can run it just like any other program or script: `./EspoTek_Labrador*.AppImage`

            If you're running 32-bit, please see the [build instructions](https://github.com/espotek-org/Labrador/wiki/Building-for-32-bit-Linux) or run the [Raspberry Pi bootstrap script](https://github.com/espotek-org/Labrador#raspberry-pi-build).

            ## macOS

            Download `Labrador.dmg` for macOS 10.13 and later.
            If you are running an older version of macOS, please use the macOS Legacy build below.

            - Drag the Labrador app into `/Applications`
            - Right-click and Open the Labrador app in your `/Applications` directory (you need to right-click and open, you can't just double-click)
            - If you see a warning message, just press the `Open` button to continue
            - That's it, you're done!  From now on you can open by simply double-clicking as you would any other app

            ## Windows

            Download `Labrador_Installer.exe` for Windows 7 or later (32-bit and 64-bit supported).

          UPLOADTOOL_BODY="${UPLOADTOOL_BODY#\"}"

          wget -N https://github.com/probonopd/uploadtool/raw/master/upload.sh
          chmod +x ./upload.sh
